# 🎬 Manim Animation Project Rules

## Core Principle: Preserve Development Richness

When creating Manim animations, automatically capture and preserve the full development journey including prompts, conversations, insights, and learnings.

---

## 📝 Automatic Documentation Requirements

### When Creating a New Animation:

1. **Create Numbered Bundle Structure:**
   - Video: `videos/XX_Animation_Name.mp4`
   - Code: `code/XX_Animation_Name.py`
   - Sound: `sounds/XX_Animation_Name.mp3` (if applicable)
   - Docs: `docs/XX_Animation_Name.md` (REQUIRED)

2. **Documentation Template** (in `docs/XX_Animation_Name.md`):
   ```markdown
   # Animation Name
   
   ## Video
   - **File:** `videos/XX_Animation_Name.mp4`
   - **Code:** `code/XX_Animation_Name.py`
   - **Sound:** `sounds/XX_Animation_Name.mp3` (if applicable)
   
   ## Description
   [What the animation shows/teaches]
   
   ## Development History
   
   ### Initial Prompts
   - [List all prompts used, verbatim]
   - [Include user feedback and requests]
   
   ### What Worked
   - [Techniques, approaches, code patterns that succeeded]

   - [Animation timing/flow that worked well]
   
   ### What Didn't Work / Challenges
   - [Failed approaches and why]
   - [Technical issues encountered]

   ### Key Insights
   - [Learnings about Manim]
   - [Visual design principles discovered]
   - [Educational effectiveness observations]
   - [Performance considerations]
   
   ### Technical Notes
   - [Code patterns used]
   - [Manim features leveraged]
   - [Configuration settings]
   - [Dependencies or special requirements]
   
   ### Prompt Style Used
   - [How prompts evolved]
   - [What made prompts effective]
   - [Iteration patterns]
   ```

## 🧠 Memory Capture Rules

### Automatically Save to Memory:

1. **When User Provides Feedback:**
   - Save the exact feedback/request
   - Note what was changed in response
   - Record outcome (worked/didn't work)

2. **When Solving Problems:**
   - Document the problem encountered
   - Save the solution approach
   - Note any workarounds or alternatives tried

3. **When User Describes Concepts:**
   - Capture the concept being visualized
   - Save the educational goal
   - Note visual metaphors or analogies used

4. **When Iterating:**
   - Track version changes
   - Save "before" and "after" states
   - Record user satisfaction with changes

5. **When Using New Techniques:**
   - Document Manim features discovered
   - Save code patterns that worked
   - Note performance implications

## 📋 File Organization Rules

### Naming Convention:
- **Use numbers:** `01_`, `02_`, `03_` etc. for easy cross-referencing
- **Descriptive names:** Clear, intuitive names (e.g., `Repository_Intro`, `Poles_and_Zeros`)
- **Consistent across folders:** Same number and name pattern in `code/`, `videos/`, `sounds/`, `docs/`

### Structure:
```
manim/
├── README.md (only one!)
├── code/
│   ├── 01_Repository_Intro.py
│   ├── 02_Poles_and_Zeros.py
│   └── XX_Animation_Name.py
├── videos/
│   ├── 01_Repository_Intro.mp4
│   ├── 02_Poles_and_Zeros.mp4
│   └── XX_Animation_Name.mp4
├── sounds/
│   ├── 01_Repository_Intro.mp3
│   └── XX_Animation_Name.mp3 (if applicable)
└── docs/
    ├── 01_Repository_Intro.md
    ├── 02_Poles_and_Zeros.md
    └── XX_Animation_Name.md (REQUIRED for each animation)
```

## 💬 Conversation Capture Guidelines

### What to Capture:

1. **User Intent:**
   - What concept are they trying to visualize?
   - What's the educational goal?
   - Who is the target audience?

2. **Iteration History:**
   - Each round of feedback
   - What changed and why
   - User satisfaction levels

3. **Technical Discoveries:**
   - Manim quirks or limitations found
   - Workarounds developed
   - Performance optimizations

4. **Design Decisions:**
   - Why certain visual choices were made
   - What alternatives were considered
   - What worked better than expected

5. **Prompt Evolution:**
   - How prompts improved over iterations
   - What phrasing was most effective
   - What led to breakthrough moments

## 🎯 When Creating New Animations

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Create numbered files:**
   ```bash
   code/XX_Animation_Name.py
   docs/XX_Animation_Name.md (create immediately!)
   ```

2. **Start documentation:**
   - Add description
   - Note initial concept/goal
   - Record first prompts used

3. **During Development:**
   - Update docs after each significant change
   - Note what worked/didn't work
   - Capture user feedback verbatim

4. **After Completion:**
   - Finalize technical notes
   - Summarize key insights
   - Document prompt style used

## 🔍 Memory Management

### Always Save:
- ✅ Exact user prompts and requests
- ✅ Technical solutions and workarounds
- ✅ User feedback (positive and negative)
- ✅ Design decisions and rationale
- ✅ Code patterns that worked well
- ✅ Manim features discovered
- ✅ Performance considerations

### Use Memory Tags:
- `#manim-technique` - For Manim-specific learnings
- `#visual-design` - For design principles
- `#educational` - For teaching effectiveness
- `#performance` - For optimization insights
- `#prompt-style` - For effective prompting patterns

---

## 📚 Documentation Quality Standards

### Good Documentation Includes:
- ✅ Complete prompt history
- ✅ Clear before/after comparisons
- ✅ Specific code examples
- ✅ Visual design rationale
- ✅ User feedback integration
- ✅ Technical challenges and solutions

### Avoid:
- ❌ Vague descriptions
- ❌ Missing context
- ❌ Incomplete prompt history
- ❌ Skipping "what didn't work" section

## 🎬 Animation Development Best Practices

1. **Start with concept clarity:** Understand what you're visualizing before coding
2. **Iterate based on feedback:** Don't assume, ask and adapt
3. **Document as you go:** Don't wait until the end
4. **Preserve the journey:** The process is as valuable as the result
5. **Learn from failures:** Document what didn't work and why

---

## 🔗 Cross-Reference System

### Easy Exploration:
- Same number = same animation across all folders
- `01_` files relate to each other
- `02_` files relate to each other
- Numbers show chronological order

### Benefits:
- Quick navigation between related files
- Easy to see what belongs together
- Chronological exploration possible
- Clear organization for future additions

---

## 🎓 Concept Visualization Guidelines

### When User Describes a Concept:

1. **Capture the Core Concept:**
   - What mathematical/physical concept?
   - What's the key insight to convey?
   - What's the "aha!" moment?

2. **Identify Visual Metaphors:**
   - What visual representation makes it intuitive?
   - What animations help understanding?
   - What comparisons or analogies work?

3. **Document Educational Approach:**
   - How to build understanding progressively?
   - What background knowledge assumed?
   - What common misconceptions to address?

4. **Save Prompt Patterns:**
   - What prompt phrasing worked?
   - How did the concept description evolve?
   - What visual requests were most effective?

---

**Remember:** The goal is to preserve the richness of insights so future animations can learn from past development journeys. Every prompt, conversation, and insight matters.
